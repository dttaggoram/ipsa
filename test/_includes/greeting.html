 <div id="welcome-greeting"><h1>Rock it with data!</h1><h2>I have been working for many years with a lot of passion in the <b>open source business intelligence</b> world. These days I run my own consultancy - a one man band with a lot of ambition. I've written many blog posts over the years - it is about time to find a dedicated home for them! Some of my old tutorials are still available on <a href='http://diethardsteiner.blogspot.co.uk'>Blogger</a>. My articles cover various <b>Open Source</b> software packages like <b>Pentaho</b>, <b>Talend</b>, <b>Jasper Reports</b>, <b>BIRT</b> and more. The main topics covered are <b>Data Integration</b>, <b>Data Warehousing</b>, <b>Data Modeling</b>, <b>BI Server Setup</b>, <b>OLAP</b>, <b>Reporting</b>, <b>Dashboarding</b>, <b>Master Data Management</b>. In a nutshell, there should be something for everyone just slightly interested in business intelligence!<hr />
