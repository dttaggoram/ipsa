We are up to an exciting **Mondrian** adventure:

1. Adding Semi-Additive Measures
2. Making these measures work across multiple date dimension hierachies
3. Calculated Measures based on the Semi-Additive Measure

Can't wait? So let's get start!

## Adding Semi-Additive Measures

Currently **Mondrian** doesn't offer a way to define **semi-additive** measures (see as well [this Jira case](http://jira.pentaho.com/browse/MONDRIAN-962)). However, Vladislav Krakhalev suggested using using the `OPENINGPERIOD()` or `CLOSINGPERIOD()` **MDX** functions as a workaround. Thanks a lot! 

This article explains how I implemented semi-additive measures in a **Mondrian Schema**. Using the `OPENINGPERIOD()` or `CLOSINGPERIOD()` **MDX** functions is actually just the start of the whole adventure!

So what are **semi-additive measures**? Let's best explain this based on an example:

Imagine you have to prepare a **subscriber base analysis** for a telecom provider. You have the obvious date dimension, tariff plan dimension, etc.

In our **OLAP** Schema the subscriber base measure currently looks like this:

```xml
<Measure name="Subscribers" column="subscribers" datatype="Integer" formatString="#,###" aggregator="sum" visible="false" />
``` 

As you can see, we use a use sum to aggregate this measure ... but this not quite right. So you can sum the subscriber base on a daily level, but once you roll up to weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly level, you have to take the first or last value of this period (whatever the client is happy with really - averages usually don't do the trick). 

First make sure you have proper **time dimension** defined (like the one shown below), so that the rollup works correctly:

```xml
<Dimension type="TimeDimension" visible="true" highCardinality="false" name="Date">
	<Hierarchy name="Monthly Calendar" visible="true" hasAll="true" allMemberName="Total" allMemberCaption="Total" primaryKey="date_tk">
		<Table name="dim_date" schema="dma_subscriber_base"/>
		<Level name="Year" visible="true" column="year4" type="Integer" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeYears" hideMemberIf="Never" />
		<Level name="Quarter" visible="true" column="year_quarter" ordinalColumn="year_quarter_int" type="String" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeQuarters" hideMemberIf="Never" />
		<Level name="Month" visible="true" column="year_month"  ordinalColunn="year_month_int" type="String" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeMonths" hideMemberIf="Never"/>
		<Level name="Date" visible="true" column="date_digits" ordinalColumn="date_tk" type="Date" uniqueMembers="true" levelType="TimeDays" hideMemberIf="Never"/>
	</Hierarchy>	
</Dimension>
```

Then use MDX functions [`OPENINGPERIOD()`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms145992.aspx) or [`CLOSINGPERIOD()`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms145584.aspx). Let's test these function for the day, month, quarter and year level. Note that we define first a calculated member which will return the sum of subscribers for the first day in a given period using the `OPENINGPERIOD()` function in this example:

```sql
WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase] AS
(
	(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date]), [Measures].[Subscribers])
) 
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]

WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase] AS
(
	(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date]), [Measures].[Subscribers])
) 
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Monthly Calendar].[Month].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]

WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase] AS
(
	(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date]), [Measures].[Subscribers])
) 
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Monthly Calendar].[Quarter].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]

WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase] AS
(
	(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date]), [Measures].[Subscribers])
) 
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Monthly Calendar].[Year].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

Our test tells us that the logic is working as expected, so the next step is to add a `CalculatedMember` to the OLAP Schema:

```xml
<CalculatedMember name="Subbase" formatString="#,##0" caption="Subbase" description="Subbase at the first day of the period" formula="(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date]), [Measures].[Subscribers])" dimension="Measures" visible="true"/>
```

This looks like a very simple workaround and should help solving quite a lot of scenarios.

## Making Calculated Measures work across multiple Date Dimension Hierarchies

Ok, one problem solved, are you up to the next challenge? With one hiearchy only in the date dimensions things are fairly straight forward. But what happens if we add a new hierarchy for the week?

```xml
<Dimension name="Date" type="TimeDimension" visible="true" highCardinality="false">
	<Hierarchy name="Monthly Calendar" visible="true" hasAll="true" allMemberName="Total" allMemberCaption="Total" primaryKey="date_tk">
		<Table name="dim_date" schema="dma_subscriber_base"/>
		<Level name="Year" visible="true" column="year4" type="Integer" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeYears" hideMemberIf="Never" />
		<Level name="Quarter" visible="true" column="year_quarter" ordinalColumn="year_quarter_int" type="String" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeQuarters" hideMemberIf="Never" />
		<Level name="Month" visible="true" column="year_month"  ordinalColunn="year_month_int" type="String" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeMonths" hideMemberIf="Never"/>
		<Level name="Date" visible="true" column="date_digits" ordinalColumn="date_tk" type="Date" uniqueMembers="true" levelType="TimeDays" hideMemberIf="Never"/>
	</Hierarchy>	
	<Hierarchy name="Weekly Calendar" visible="true" hasAll="true" allMemberName="Total" allMemberCaption="Total" primaryKey="date_tk">
		<Table name="dim_date" schema="dma_subscriber_base"/>
		<Level name="Year" visible="true" column="year_week_based" type="Integer" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeYears" hideMemberIf="Never" />
		<Level name="Week" visible="true" column="year_week"  ordinalColumn="year_week_int" type="String" uniqueMembers="false" levelType="TimeWeeks" hideMemberIf="Never"/>
		<Level name="Date" visible="true" column="date_digits" ordinalColumn="date_tk" type="Date" uniqueMembers="true" levelType="TimeDays" hideMemberIf="Never"/>
	</Hierarchy>
</Dimension>
```

If we want to get the weekly stats now like shown below we will get no result:

```sql
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Weekly Calendar].[Year].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

This is because we defined our calculated member to only work with the **Monthly Calendar**. We have to find a way to make our calculated measure work **across all date hierarchies**.

Let's just make sure that our `OPENINGPERIOD()` is still returning the expected results with these two date hierarchies:

```sql
SELECT
OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date]) On Columns,
[Measures].[Subscribers] On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

In my case this didn't return anything: no measure value and no date member. So let's check if we get a result with the `CLOSINGPERIOD()` function:

```sql
SELECT
CLOSINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date]) On Columns,
[Measures].[Subscribers] On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

This time I got a date member returned: 2019-12 (which happened to be the last month in my date dimension), but no measure value. But hold on ... why do we get a month returned when we run the function on the **Weekly Calendar** hierarchy? My guess is that this happens because the **Monthly Calendar** happens to be the default hierarchy.

We can fix this by specifying the optional **Member Expression** for the `OPENINGPERIOD()` function:

```sql
SELECT
OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date],[Date.Weekly Calendar].[2014]) On Columns,
[Measures].[Subscribers] On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]

SELECT
OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date],[Date.Monthly Calendar].[2014]) On Columns,
[Measures].[Subscribers] On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

In both cases we get the expected results now.

Next we have to find a way to get the calculated measures working **across all the hiearchies**. We could try to achieve this by creating a new calculated measure and using a **IIF** statement. Let's just simply check if this would work:

```sql
WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar] AS
(
	OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date], [Date.Monthly Calendar].CurrentMember)
	, [Measures].[Subscribers]
)
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar] AS
(
	OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date], [Date.Weekly Calendar].CurrentMember)
	, [Measures].[Subscribers]
)
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Final] AS
(
	IIF([Date.Monthly Calendar].currentmember.level.ordinal > 0
		, [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar]
		, [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar]
	)
)
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase Final] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Monthly Calendar].[Month].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]

WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar] AS
(
	OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date], [Date.Monthly Calendar].CurrentMember)
	, [Measures].[Subscribers]
)
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar] AS
(
	OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date], [Date.Weekly Calendar].CurrentMember)
	, [Measures].[Subscribers]
)
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Final] AS
(
	IIF(
		[Date.Monthly Calendar].currentmember.level.ordinal > 0
		, [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar]
		, [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar]
	)
)
SELECT
[Measures].[Subbase Final] On Columns,
Non Empty({[Date.Weekly Calendar].[Week].Members}) On Rows
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

The results are correct. Let's implement this in our **Mondrian OLAP Schema**:

```xml
<CalculatedMember name="Subbase Monthly Calendar" formatString="#,##0"  formula="(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date], [Date.Monthly Calendar].CurrentMember), [Measures].[Subscribers])" dimension="Measures" visible="false"/>
<CalculatedMember name="Subbase Weekly Calendar" formatString="#,##0"  formula="(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date], [Date.Weekly Calendar].CurrentMember), [Measures].[Subscribers])" dimension="Measures" visible="false"/>
<CalculatedMember name="Subbase" formatString="#,##0" caption="Subbase" description="Subbase at the first day of the period" formula="IIF([Date.Monthly Calendar].currentmember.level.ordinal > 0, [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar], [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar])" dimension="Measures" visible="true"/>
```

As you can see we specified the first two calculated measures as hidden (they are intermediate steps and should not be exposed to the end-user).
The beauty of this is that now our end-user only has to deal with one measure (irrespective of whatever date hiearchy they choose).

**Note**: There are also other approaches to define which measure to apply for a specific **date dimension hierarchy**:

```sql
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Final] AS
(
	IIF(
		[Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.name = 'Date' 
		OR [Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.name = 'Week' 
		OR [Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.name = 'Year'
		, [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar]
		, [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar]
	)
)
```

or even:

```sql
MEMBER [Measures].[Subbase Final] AS
(
	CASE 
		WHEN 
			(
			[Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.name = 'Date' 
			OR [Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.name = 'Week'
			OR [Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.name = 'Year'
			)
		THEN [Measures].[Subbase Weekly Calendar]
		ELSE [Measures].[Subbase Monthly Calendar]
	END
)
```

This is the one I finally decided on (unrelated to the examples given above):

```xml
<!-- Subscribers Semi-Additive Measure -->
<CalculatedMember name="Subscribers Monthly Calendar" formatString="#,##0"
    formula="(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Day of the Month], [Date.Monthly Calendar].CurrentMember), [Measures].[Subscribers Non Additive])" 
    dimension="Measures" visible="false"/>
<CalculatedMember name="Subscribers Weekly Calendar" formatString="#,##0"
    formula="(OPENINGPERIOD([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Day of the Week], [Date.Weekly Calendar].CurrentMember), [Measures].[Subscribers Non Additive])" 
    dimension="Measures" visible="false"/>
<CalculatedMember name="Subscribers" formatString="#,##0" caption="Subscribers" description="Subbase at the first day of the period" 
    formula="IIF([Date.Monthly Calendar].currentmember.level.ordinal > 0
    , [Measures].[Subscribers Monthly Calendar]
    , IIF([Date.Weekly Calendar].currentmember.level.ordinal > 0
    , [Measures].[Subscribers Weekly Calendar]
    , NULL
    ))"
    dimension="Measures" visible="true"/>
```

**Note**: the else case in the above statement has to be NULL and not [Measures].[Subscribers Non Additive] because we do not want the partially aggregated measure to be summed up in any case. This is especially important in case you write a MDX query like the one shown below, which shows results for a few weeks and then a total at the end:

```sql
WITH 
SET WEEKS AS ([Date.Weekly Calendar].[2014].[W35] : [Date.Weekly Calendar].[2014].[W38])
MEMBER [Date.Weekly Calendar].[TotalWeeks] as AGGREGATE(WEEKS)
SELECT
    { WEEKS,  [Date.Weekly Calendar].[TotalWeeks] } * [Measures].[Subscribers] ON COLUMNS
    , {[Brand].Members} ON ROWS
FROM [Subscriber Base]
```

In this case we used the `AGGREGATE()` function to retrieve the **total**. The important point here is, that this **will not return any results**: So you will see an empty total column. I would say that you either want the total column to be empty in this care to have again the first of the period displayed. In my case, the first scenario was acceptable.



## Calculated Measures based on the Semi-Additive Measure

Next we want to analyse the **subscriber base changes** from one period to the next. We will create a new calculated measure therefor. 

This is the point where things get a bit tricky. We have to add a logic again which figures out which particular **date dimension hierarchy** is used. Now ideally this shouldn't be the case, because - remember - we already defined this logic for our **semi-additive measure**. I supposed this is one of the disadvantages of have no built-in support for **semi-additive measures** in **Mondrian**.

Let's first create the **Calculated Member** for the amout of subscribers for the pervious period:

```xml
<CalculatedMember name="Subscribers Previous Period" 
formula="IIF([Date.Monthly Calendar].currentmember.level.ordinal > 0,
([Date.Monthly Calendar].[Date].CurrentMember.PrevMember,[Measures].[Subscribers]), 
([Date.Weekly Calendar].[Date].CurrentMember.PrevMember,[Measures].[Subscribers]))" 
dimension="Measures" visible="false"/>
```

Next define the formula to calculate the **delta**:

```xml
<CalculatedMember name="Subscriber Base Change" 
formula="IIF(
ISEMPTY([Measures].[Subscribers]) OR [Measures].[Subscribers Previous Period] = 0
, NULL
, ([Measures].[Subscribers] - [Measures].[Subscribers Previous Period]))" 
dimension="Measures" visible="true"/>
```

We do a few thorough checks to make sure the results are as expected - after which we happily clap our hands and call it a day!
