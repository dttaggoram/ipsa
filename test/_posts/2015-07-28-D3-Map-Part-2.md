This is the second article in the **D3** series. Previously, in the [D3 Map: Getting Started](/d3/2015/06/06/D3-Map-Part-1.html), we started working on our **GB** map and tried to apply colour coding. In this article we will feed in the **UK General Election Results 2015** data dynamically by using the **CDA** data services provided by the **open source** version of the **Pentaho BA Server**.

All files related to this project can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/diethardsteiner/diethardsteiner.github.io/tree/master/sample-files/gis/uk-election-results/).

## Integrating D3 Maps With Pentaho CDE Dashboards

The **Pentaho BA Server** offers some fantastic features to create and publish dashboards using **C-Tools**. As **C-Tools** dashboards are based on standard **HTML5** technologies, it is fairly straight forward in most cases to add new technologies like **D3**.

In general, we have to consider a few points: We know that our **map** file is fairly big in comparison to the **data**/features. When presenting the map in the web browser, it would be best to only load the map once (and hence not reload it completely with any change of the displayed feature data). We will assume that our data is not static, which means we cannot just combine the data with the **TopoJSON** file. Combining the data with the **TopoJSON** is also not a good idea if we want to grant restricted access to the data for a specific audience. Data access features are already implemented as part of the **Pentaho BA Server** and we do not want to reinvent the wheel here. 

So our strategy is as follows:

- Use standard Pentaho data sources (in this case **CDA** (Community Data Access) to load all the feature data (e.g. election data)
- Load the map from the **TopoJSON** file once. Currently CDA does not seem to support any GIS databases.
- Join the map and feature data using **JavaScript** code.

First let's create a dedicated schema on our **PostgreSQL** database with the required tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE elections;

\c elections

CREATE SCHEMA stg_d3_map;

CREATE TABLE stg_d3_map.uk_voting_results
(
    firstname VARCHAR(255)
    , lastname VARCHAR(255)
    , party_name VARCHAR(255)
    , constituency_name VARCHAR(255)
    , press_association_number INTEGER
    , ons_gss_code VARCHAR(20)
    , count_votes INTEGER
    , share_votes NUMERIC  
)
;

CREATE INDEX uvr_press_association_number 
ON stg_d3_map.uk_voting_results(press_association_number)
;

CREATE TABLE stg_d3_map.uk_voting_constituencies
(
    press_association_number INTEGER
  , constituency_name VARCHAR(255)
  , ons_gss_code VARCHAR(20)
  , constituency_type VARCHAR(20)
  , count_eligible_electors INTEGER
  , count_valid_votes INTEGER
)
;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uvc_press_association_number 
ON stg_d3_map.uk_voting_constituencies(press_association_number)
;


CREATE VIEW stg_d3_map.vw_uk_voting_winners
AS
SELECT
    constituency_name
    , a.ons_gss_code
    , party_name
    , a.count_votes
    , a.share_votes
FROM stg_d3_map.uk_voting_results a
INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT 
        press_association_number
        , MAX(count_votes) AS count_votes
    FROM stg_d3_map.uk_voting_results
    WHERE
        press_association_number IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1
) b
ON
    a.press_association_number = b.press_association_number
    AND a.count_votes = b.count_votes
;
```

If you do not have **PostgreSQL** installed but another database, it should be fairly easy to create a similar schema there as well.

Let's import the data using the **PDI** transformation `tr_import_election_data.ktr` which you can download from [here](https://github.com/diethardsteiner/diethardsteiner.github.io/tree/master/sample-files/gis/uk-election-results/) inside the `etl` folder. Make sure you download the whole project folder, so that the election results data is included as well. Run this transformation from Spoon (the PDI GUI client) or from the command line with `pan.sh`. 

Finally check with your favourite **SQL** if the data was imported:

```sql
SELECT * FROM stg_d3_map.uk_voting_winners LIMIT 20;
```

We have to join the map details and the election results based on the  `pcon13cd` and `ons_gss_code` fields (which hold both the same data):

```bash
topojson \
      --id-property PCON13CD \
      --properties name=PCON13NM \
      -o constituencies-cde.topo.json \
      constituencies.json
```  

We will later on upload the **TopoJSON** file to the **Pentaho BA Server**.

For the next few steps I will only provide a brief description. If you need an introduction to **Pentaho C-Tools** (C for Community), you will be able to find enough resources on the internet.

Log on to the **Pentaho BA Server** and make sure you have a  connection defined to the database we just created. Create a new **dashboard** using **CDE**.

In the **Data Source** panel define a new **SQL Query** (SQL over JNDI), name it `qry_parties` and define following query: 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT party_name FROM stg_d3_map.uk_voting_results;
```

Create another query called `qry_party_share` and specify following query:

```sql
SELECT
    ons_gss_code
    , share_votes AS count_votes
FROM stg_d3_map.uk_voting_results
WHERE
    party_name = ${param_party}
;
```

As parameter define `param_party`.

Save the dashboard in the dedicated folder. When you go to the **Browse Files** perspective you should now see a **CDA** (Community Data Access) file. Double click on it. Once it is opened, choose the defined query from the pull down menu and you should see the result of the query displayed (don't forget to provide a parameter value).

Now we do know that the queries are working properly.
Go back to **CDE**.

In the **Layout** panel: 

1. Add a row and a column. Name the column `html_select_party`.
2. Add another row and a column. Name the column `html_map`. 
3. Add an **internal CSS resource** and add following styles:
	
    ```css
    path {
        fill: #e5e5e5;
        stroke: #fff;
        stroke-width: 0.5px;
    }

    .q0-9 { fill:rgb(247,251,255); }
    .q1-9 { fill:rgb(222,235,247); }
    .q2-9 { fill:rgb(198,219,239); }
    .q3-9 { fill:rgb(158,202,225); }
    .q4-9 { fill:rgb(107,174,214); }
    .q5-9 { fill:rgb(66,146,198); }
    .q6-9 { fill:rgb(33,113,181); }
    .q7-9 { fill:rgb(8,81,156); }
    .q8-9 { fill:rgb(8,48,107); }
    ```

4. Download the **JavaScript** dependencies, e.g. on the command line:
	
	```bash
	cd ~/Downloads
	wget https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.5/d3.min.js
	wget https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/topojson/1.6.19/topojson.min.js
	```
5. In the **Pentaho User Console** (in simple words the website of your Petaho BA Server) upload these files into the directory where the dashboard is saved in (using the **Browse Files** perspective). Also upload the `constituencies-cde.topo.json` file (the **TopoJSON** map file). 

	> Note: It might be that you get an error message when uploading the **JSON** map file. In this case, open `pentaho-solutions/system/ImportHandlerMimeTypeDefinitions.xml` in a good text editor and add the following inside the `<MimeTypeDefinitions>` element:

	```xml
	<MimeTypeDefinition mimeType="application/json" hidden="false">
		<extension>json</extension>
	</MimeTypeDefinition>
	``` 
	**Restart** the **BA Server** for the changes to take effect.
	
6. Go back to the **Opened** perspective to see your dashboard. Back in the **Layout** panel, specify the two JavaScript files as **external JavaScript resources**.

In the **Components** panel add a **Simple Parameter** from the **General** section. Name the parameter `param_party`.

- Name: `param_party`

Add a **SelectComponent** from the **Select** section.

- Name: `comp_select_party`
- Parameter: `param_party`
- Datasource: `qry_parties`
- HTMLObject: `html_select_party`

In the **Components** panel add a **Query Component** from the **Others** section. Set the following properties:

- Name: `comp_map`
- Listener: `param_party`
- Parameter: `param_party`
- HtmlObject: `html_map`
- Datasource: `qry_party_share`
- ResultVar: `election_results` 
- Add this to the **PostExecution** function:

```javascript
function(){
    var election_results_d3 = [];
    
    for(var i=0; i < election_results.length; i++){
        var dataObject = {};
        dataObject.ons_gss_code = election_results[i][0];
        dataObject.count_votes = election_results[i][1];
        election_results_d3.push(dataObject);
    }
    
    // CREATE MAP
    
    // only create map if it does not exist already
    
    if( $('#election-map').length === 0 ){
        
        //var width = 700,
          //  height = 1000;
        
        var width = 500,
            height = 800;
        
        var projection = d3.geo.albers()
            //.center([0, 55.4])
            .center([3, 54])
            .rotate([4.4, 0])
            .parallels([50, 60])
            .scale(4000)
            .translate([width / 2, height / 2])
            //.translate(200,200)
            ;
        
        var path = d3.geo.path()
            .projection(projection);
        
        //var svg = d3.select('body').append('svg')
        var svg = d3.select('#html_map').append('svg')
            .attr('width', width)
            .attr('height', height)
            .attr('id', 'election-map')
        ;
        
        d3.json('constituencies-cde.topo.json', function(error, topology) {
            // create a polygon for every constituency
            svg.selectAll('.constituency')
                // retrieve the features so that we can access the id
                .data(topojson.feature(topology, topology.objects.constituencies).features)
                .enter().append('path')
                //.attr('class', function(d) { return 'constituency ' + d.id; })
                .attr('id', function(d) { return d.id; })
                .attr('d', path)
                ;
    
        });
    }
    
    // ADD COLOR CODES
    
    var quantize = d3.scale.quantize()
    .domain([
        d3.min(election_results_d3, function(d) { return d.count_votes; })
        , d3.max(election_results_d3, function(d) { return d.count_votes; })
        ]) 
    .range(d3.range(9).map(function(i) { return "q" + i + "-9"; }))
    // Note 9 define in the range() function relates to the 9 CSS styles we defined above
    ;
    
    // remove any previous color codes
    // as we might not have data for all constituencies
    // the new styles would only overwrite the color code of some constituences
    // but not others
    $('path').removeAttr('class');
    
    
    // assign new color codes
    election_results_d3.forEach(function(elt, i) {
        $('#' + elt.ons_gss_code).attr('class', quantize(elt.count_votes));
    });
} 
```

A few notes on the code changes: 

- We nest the map within the `#html_map` element now (`d3.select('#html_map').append('svg')`).
- Our code checks if the map is already loaded or not - this avoids reloading the map when the user changes the data selection. We add the id `election-map` (`.attr('id', 'election-map')`) to the SVG element to make this happen.
- Each time the user changes the data selection, all the color codes get removed and only then the new color codes get applied. We cannot just replace the existing color codes, because it might be that a specific political party is not present for one of the constituencies.

> **Note**: To preview the dashboard you can just click on the **Preview** icon within **CDE**. However, previewing the dashboard this way didn't show the map in my case. I had to go to the **Browse Files** perspective and chose the option **Open in new window**. 

If you spend a little bit more time on the creating the dashboard, you can show the winners by constituency and also the share for each party by constituency.

The **winners** by constituency:

![](/images/gis-d3-9.png)

The **share for a selected party** by constituency: In this case the Labour party is selected. Note that the color of the party is used for the color shades in the map:

![](/images/gis-d3-8.png)

There is still quite a lot that can be done to improve the map. Currently it is very static, so adding e.g. a zoom function and popup info (to show further info) for each constituency would be the next steps to do.
