# The report designer I always wanted to have?

Classic report designers like **PRD** and **JasperReports** are mostly geared towards generating long (and sometimes nested) tables. Quite often this is not required. The common use case these days is to create a dashboard and offer a PDF download as an alternative. If someone wants to export the data to Excel, you can just add an export button directly to the tables that you show in your dashboard.

One thing that I also always disliked about the classic report engines is that you have to work with **sub-reports**, if you want to add more than one query. This is a bit cumbersome and I might argue a bit counter-intuitive. What I've been saying for a few years now is that a modern reporting engine should just allow you start with a completely blank canvas and allow you to add objects (charts, tables, etc), for which you can define a data source. Simple. Pentaho CDE basically just does this, but it is mainly geared towards HTML dashboards. 

In the past offering a **PDF** version of a **CDE dashboard** meant creating a separate report in PRD mostly completely from scratch. So you basically have to do the work more or less twice. This gab had to be closed! We had to find an relative easy way to generate a PDF.

Now you cannot treat the different media (print, screen) completely the same: You will always have to do some minor adjustments, especially in regards to styling. But the goal is to reuse everything else.

The styling for the dashboard is achieved using **CSS**. Why not use CSS for print/pdf as well? Is it possible? This is the main question that had to be answered. 

Luckily, the **W3C** has a **working draft** on this subject: [W3C CSS3 Paged Media](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-page-3/). While **CSS2** introduced already a few features for print (see [W3C CSS2 Paged Media](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/page.html)), the new working draft for **CSS3** includes a huge bunch of features that will make CSS a serious contendor for styling print documents. We will make use of this one.

Ok, so that's great, there is a working draft, but has anyone implemented it yet? Currently there doesn't seem to be a browser support for it (there are some conflicting messages on the internet about it, but in a nutshell it seem like right now, there is no support). There are some commericial products available that support it partially (e.g. Prince), but this is not an option for us. All lost? No. Luckily, there is an open source tool of the name **WeasyPrint** available, which implements the W3C working draft. **WeasyPrint** is an html-to-pdf converter writting in Python, which will use the `@media print` rule in your CSS to style to PDF.

# WeasyPrint

This open source converter supports already the [W3C CSS3 Paged Media](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-page-3/) working draft!

> **Note**: WeasyPrint doesn't support **JavaScript** or `<canvas>`, so you have to preprocess the files somehow to emit HTML/CSS or SVG.

## Installation

Please find [here](http://weasyprint.org/docs/install/#mac-os-x) the install instructions.

Mac OS X:

```
brew install pkg-config libffi
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig pip install cffi
brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
brew install gettext
brew install python cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libxml2 libxslt
sudo pip install WeasyPrint
weasyprint --help
```


Fedora:

```
sudo yum install gcc

sudo yum install python-devel python-pip python-lxml cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2 libffi-devel

sudo pip install WeasyPrint
weasyprint --help
```

To render SVG images, you will also have to install [CairoSVG](http://cairosvg.org/download/). On Fedora, you can install [this package](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/python-cairosvg/):

```
sudo yum install python-cairosvg
```

or:

```
sudo pip install cairosvg
```


Install instructions for other distros can be found on the [CairoSVG](http://cairosvg.org/download/) website.

Also check the supported SVG features [here](http://cairosvg.org/svg_support/#idid96). Report any SVG issues [here](https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG).


You can either use the command line options to convert the **HTML** file to **PDF** or you can start a server like this:

```
python -m weasyprint.navigator
```

Open your favourite web browser and enter `127.0.0.1:5000`. Enter the full path to your local html file into the input box and click on **Go**. Now you will see a preview. This is especially useful when developing the stylesheet!

[This](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/235#issuecomment-73864846) seems to be realted to [CFFI](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.8/)

To fix this, run:

```
brew install pkg-config libffi
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig pip install cffi
```

as outlined [here](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.8/#macos-x).


## Limitations

While **WeayPrint** implements a lot of **CSS** features, not everythig that you can do in a standard web browser is available. Read [this](http://weasyprint.org/docs/features/#css-2-1) and [this](http://weasyprint.org/docs/features/#other-css-modules) to understand, which CSS features are not supported.

The input HTML has to be preprocessed. This can be easily worked around by using **PhantomJS** or similar.

Another smaller drawback is that inline **SVG** rendering is currently not supported. This is not a big problem as long as you get the prerendered SVG via CGG from CCC e.g.

In a nutshull: There is no real show stopper!

# Using CSS for Print - Lessons Learnt

First it is very important to understand the [page model](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-page-3/#page-model):

![](/images/css-for-print/PageBox.png)


Understanding **Page Margin Boxes** is elementary for creating headers and footers:

![](/images/css-for-print/margin-boxes.png)

You do not have to define all the **page margin boxes**. If you do not define one of the margin boxes, the one left to it can consume all of its space - this can easily be achieved by setting the width to 100%.
Keep in mind that width can be specified in `cm` or `percentage`. Do not use `px` or `em`. Using percentage is probably the easiest approach, as it is unlikely that margin boxes will overlap.
Note that `@top-left`, `@top-center` and `@top-right` share the same space, so if you define in example on `@top-left` and `@top-right`, you could set the width of the first one to 70% and the other one to 30%.
Note that you do not have to define a width or height for the the corners, as they are defined by the page margins! 

![](/images/css-for-print/header-ex-6.png)

Also keep in mind that any padding adds to the size of the page margin box.

Another advice ([Source](http://webdesign.about.com/od/advancedcss/qt/at-page-rule.htm)):

"Print measurements include points, picas, inches, centimeters, and millimeters. Don't use any measurements that are relative to the screen resolution (pixels) or the parent elements (em and ex) or relative to the surrounding text or default browser size (percentages and xx-small/xx-large respectively)."

# Practical example

What follows is a brief walkthrough of my very basic workflow:

## Design your report

This should be fairly straight forward: Nothing new to learn! Everything is based on standards like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **SVG**. You do not have to use any new and dedicated report designer! Just use your favourite editor and that's it! Switch on the web preview option in your editor and you have a super fast working environment!

You only have to apply some common sense principles of what will not work in print (as opposed to the web): There is no interaction, etc.

We will get all our data from the **Pentaho** BA-Server using **CDA** (Community Data Access). You can use their charting library as well (**CCC**, short for Community Charts Component), ideally via **CGG** (Community Graphics Generator). This option will output SVG directly, which we can use on our report: See [this blogpost](http://diethardsteiner.github.io/prd/2015/02/10/Pentaho-CCC.html) on how to do this. 
Alternatively you can also use **D3js** for charting.

The most important bit is of course the CSS. Let's have a quick look at this:

Let's set up first the **page** and define the **header** and **footer**. We also add a **page counter** to the header:

```css
@page {

	size: A4 portrait;
	margin: 1.5cm 1.5cm 1.5cm 1.5cm; 

	@top-left-corner {
		content: ""; /* has to be specified! */
		background-color: rgba(42, 201, 80, 0.220);
		border-bottom: solid green; 
	}

	@top-left {
		width: 70%;
		content: "";
		background: url('images/logo_v4.png'), rgba(42, 201, 80, 0.220);
		background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
		background-position: left center, left;
		background-size: contain; /* 5cm, cover or 100%: scale bg image, retains img ratio */ 
		border-bottom: solid green;
	} 

	@top-right {
		width: 30%;
		content: "Page " counter(page) " of " counter(pages);
		vertical-align: middle; 
		font-family: sans-serif;
		font-weight: bold;
		font-size: 0.7cm;
		color: white;
		text-align: center;
		background-color: #53c963;
		border-bottom: solid green;
		}

	@top-right-corner { 
		content: " "; 
		background-color: rgba(42, 201, 80, 0.220);
		/* background-color: #79caff; */
		border-bottom: solid green; 
	}

	@bottom-center {
		width: 100%;
		content: "Reporting Powered by Open Source Software";
		vertical-align: middle; 
		font-family: sans-serif;
		font-weight: bold;
		font-size: 0.7cm;
		color: green;
	}

}
```

Next we define a rule, which applies the styles to **all** output types:

```css
@media all {

	.section-title {
		color: black;
		font-weight: bold;
		text-align: left;
		clear: both;
	}
	
	.box-container-title {
		width: 100%;
		background: rgba(255, 127, 42, 0.75);
		color: white;
		font-weight: bold;
		text-align: left;
	}	
	
	.container-title {
		width: 100%;
		height: 100%;
		vertical-align: middle;
	}
	
	...	
}
```

> **Note**: In the **all** rule I didn't mention any properties that require an exact measure, e.g. px, em, cm, mm etc. We will define the styles again in the output specific rules (print, screen, etc) and add these properties there. For **print** we will use `mm` and `cm`, whereas for **screen** `px` and `em`.


Next we define a rule for **print**:

```css
@media print {
  html, body {
		font-family: sans-serif;
		background: none;
		color: black;
	}
	.section-title {
		font-size: 0.7cm;
		padding-top: 0.17cm;
		margin-top: 0.5cm;
		margin-bottom: 0.2cm;
	}
	
	.box-container-title {
		height: 0.6cm;
		font-size: 0.5cm;
		padding-bottom: 0.12cm;
		margin-bottom: 0.2cm;
	}
	.container-title {
		padding-top: 0.17cm;
		padding-left: 0.2cm;
	}
	...
}	
```

And finally we create a rule for output type **screen**:

```css
@media screen {
	html, body {
		font-family: sans-serif;
		background: none;
		color: black;
	}
	
	.section-title {
		font-size: 1em;
		text-align: left;
		padding-top: 0.1em;
		margin-top: 0.3em;
		margin-bottom: 0.3em;
	}
	
	.box-container-title {
		height: 20px;
		background: rgba(255, 127, 42, 0.75);
		font-size: 0.9em;
		margin-bottom: 0.2em;
		font-size: 0.9em;
		margin-bottom: 0.2em;
	}	
	.container-title {
		padding-top: 0.1em;
		padding-left: 0.2em;
	}
	...
}
```

If you are a bit familiar with **CSS**, this is fairly straight forward to set up.

Now let's briefly talk about the common report elements: charts and tables.

Charts can be easily added to your HTML file like this:

```html
<img src="http://localhost:8080/pentaho/plugin/cgg/api/services/draw?script=/public/Dashboards/Report/Quarterly-Report_comp_chart_consumption.js&outputType=svg&userid=admin&password=password">	
```

Well, certainly this approach is not meant for production environments (you do not want to make the username and password visible like this!) - this is just for dev/testing in your local editor - you can later on remove the authentication details. All the above does is source a **Pentaho CCC chart**, which was created in CDE, via CGG.

In regards to creating tables, you can just use **d3js** therefor and source the data from CDA.

## Preprocessing the HTML server side

Our report (consisting of HTML, JavaScript and CSS files) includes various dynamic elements. **WeasyPrint** cannot handle input this way ... we have to preprocess these files to get to final HTML output.

### PhantomJS to the rescue

As previously stated, **WeasyPrint** cannot handle **JavaScript**. The solution is to preprocess it server side using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). 

> **Note**: Certainly you could make use of the classic server side scripting languages like JSP, ASP etc. But I'd argue that the traditional dashboard designer is more familiar with client side scripting and the approach outlined here doesn't really introduce a lot of new learning requirements.

Installation instructions can be found [here](http://phantomjs.org/download.html). If you are using Mac OS X and Homebrew, you can just install it like this:

```
brew install phantomjs
```

Once installed just write this simple **JavaScript**:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var page = require('webpage').create();
var url = 'file://' + fs.absolute('./sample1.html');

page.open(url, function (status) {
  if(status === "success") {
	  console.log(page.content);
  }
 	phantom.exit();
});
```

Then execute on the command line:

```
phantomjs generator.js > output.html
```

And your `sample1.html` page will be rendered and the output saved to a dedicated file. So if you used **D3js** in `sample1.html` to dynamically render a table, the output file will have the full table HTML in it.

Some info was sourced from [this blog post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/26/love-generating-svg-javascript-move-to-server/)

### Preview the print output using weasyprint.navigator

Now that we have the preprocessed **HTML** output, let's preview the print output using the handy weasyprint.navigator server.

```
python -m weasyprint.navigator
```

Open your favourite web browser and enter `127.0.0.1:5000`.

Paste the full filepath to `output.html` into the input field and click **Go**. If you are happy with the preview, you can also download the pdf by clicking on the **PDF** link.

# Other Notes

## Preprocessing

### NodeJS: JSDOM

Another option to preprocess the HTML is via NodeJS and JSDOM:

[Source](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/26/love-generating-svg-javascript-move-to-server/)


Install [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) like this:

```
npm install jsdom
```

Finally execute:

```
node index.js > result.svg
```

### D3JS or CCC

If you decide not to use Pentaho CDE for creating the charts and prefer coding the charts (d3js or CCC) directly in your HTML or separate JavaScript file, make sure you preprocess everything before handing it over to WeasyPrint. NodeJS should offer you enough tools to do this. Currently WeasyPrint does not have support for inline SVG.

### Thougths

In theory you could process everything on the server side using **NodeJS** and use **WebSocket** or **socket.io** (the later one will support both WebSocket where available and provide Polyfills otherwise) to "transport" the PDF to the client.

Here some interesting, related blog posts:

# My example

I put together a very basic example of using CSS for creating PDF reports. The code can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/diethardsteiner/css-for-print).

# Conclusion

**CSS3 for paged media** is a very promising standard, which will be hopefully implemented be more open source/free solutions in the future. Currently WeasyPrint seems to be the only open source tool available and it allows us to freely explore the new CSS3 features. It is very handy that it comes with a demo server to quickly preview the PDF output.

Is **WeasyPrint** a viable additation to the Pentaho BA Server environment? This has to be very wisely thought about: WeasyPrint is writting in **Python** and this fact doesn't naturally make it fit into the **Java** world Pentaho relies on. There could be ways to integrate it, so that easy solutions are possible, but someone would first have to build this bridge. In general it would be great if there was an open source tool based on **Java** or **JavaScript** around, which could be easily integrated - however, there isn't one right now. Another hope is that in future **web browsers** will natively support the CSS3 for paged media specification/recommendation. This would certainly be the best case scenario. I am hoping for the latter on to happen.
