This is a short article on some of the problems you might encounter when working with **Pentaho Data Integration** on **Mac OS X**:

## Cannot start Spoon via the app launcher

When starting Spoon via the app launcher you might get asked to install Java 6 (although you have already Java installed) or you might get an error message like this: "Data Integration is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to trash."

Currently there doesn't seem to be a way around this problem. You can only start Spoon via the shell script.

## Fixing the unresponsive file dialog

[Jira case](http://jira.pentaho.com/browse/PDI-12824)

When opening or saving a file, you might see the spinning wheel for ages in the file dialog - nothing is happening. This is usually happening on Mac OS X Mavericks and jre 1.7.

Download the latest stable Mac SWT jar file from [Eclipse Standard Widget Toolkit](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) website and add it to `<pdi-root>/libswt/osx64`.

Download the latest Oracle Java Version. As Nelson points out in the jira case mentioned above, version `1.7.0_51-b13` and later seem to have fixed this problem.

## Useful keyboard shortcuts

I just list shortcuts here which are not listed in the UI:

keyborad shortcut | description
------------------|------------
SHIFT + CMD + Space | Show variables list
SHIFT + CMD + arrow OR ALT + CMD + arrow | Align steps/job entries
ALT + CMD + up or down arrow | Move row up or down in a config table (e.g. Select Values step)
fn + DEL | Delete row in a config table

## Text and icons too small on the Retina display

That's an easy one: Just go to **Tools > Options ... > Look & Feel** and adjust the icon and font size.

## Data Grid and other configuration options

With the **Data Grid** step you will have to hit **Enter** once a value was entered, otherwise it will just disappear. Marcello Pontes also mentioned that you can use the **Tab** key instead as well.

Nelson Sousa mentioned: "When you have a field active to edit, press enter before clicking anywhere else. If not you get one of those array out of bounds things. Ignore it, continue with spoon, save and restart. :)"
