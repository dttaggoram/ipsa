I am up as a speaker at the forthcoming **Pentaho London User Group** (PLUG) meeting on the 22nd of July at **[Skillsmatter](https://skillsmatter.com/)** - check out the **[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Pentaho-London-User-Group/events/178590472/)** details. I'll be talking about how to create a *data mart* with **Pentaho Data Integration** (a.k.a. Kettle). 
The PLUG Meetup is an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas with other professionals working in the same area. The forthcoming meeting has a very interesting series of talks featuring Pentaho community heavyweights *[Matt Casters](http://www.ibridge.be/)* (the guy who built Pentaho Kettle), *[Mark Melton](http://markmelton-bi.blogspot.com/)*, *Harris Ward* and *[Tom Barber](http://themagicaltrout.wordpress.com/)*. The meetup is organized by *[Dan Keeley](http://dankeeley.wordpress.com/)*.
My talk will demonstrate how to setup a **Kimball**-style star schema with **open source** packages: **Pentaho Data Integration** and *columnar* database **MonetDB**. This is extremly useful as well for prototyping as there is no software cost involved. 
Having said this, I hope to see you at the **PLUG** meetup on the 22n of July!
