# Simplifying the topography file

[OPEN] read: http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-12-07

[OPEN] TopoJSON also has a `presimplify` function, which allows you to dynamicly simplify the mapping data based e.g. on zoom level. See [this example](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/7755778). This uses canvas.

Example using svg: [Line Simplification](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/)


What about the `presimplify` function: 

//simplify topology
    topojson.presimplify(topology);

There is also an option via the command line using the `topojson` command with the `-s` for simplify flag ([source](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5557726)):

```bash
topojson \
    --width 960 \
    --height 800 \
    --margin 20 \
    -s .25 \
    -o ca.json \
    -- counties=counties-projected.shp
```


| method | environment 
|  ------	| ------	|  
| topojson.simplify | server side (nodejs?)  
| topojson.presimplify | client side (browser)

## Best approach

1. Upload it to [Mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org) and use their simplify function. Make sure you click the **Repair** feature if available. Download as GeoJSON so that we can still define the id etc. (See if you can do a similar thing in QGIS).
2. Use the topojson command to convert GeoJSON file.
3. Remove transform (scale, translate) at the end of the file.

QGIS: Vector > Geometry Tools > Simplify Geometries: Hm, not really great results

## Alternative

The topojson file is still fairly large, let's try simplifying it further. The excellent article [Spatial data on a diet: tips for file size reduction using TopoJSON](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/04/22/spatial-data-on-a-diet-tips-for-file-size-reduction-using-topojson/) by Zav Ross outlines a few possibilties to slim down the file:

```
topojson \
  --id-property PCON13CDO \
  --properties name=PCON13NM \
  -q 5000 \
  -s 1e-8 \
  -o constituencies.topo.json \
  constituencies.json
```

If we check the file size now, we see that our topojson file only takes up only 1.4MB now.

```
topojson \
  --id-property PCON13CDO \
  --properties name=PCON13NM \
  -q 5000 \
  -s 1e-8 \
  -o constituencies.topo.json \
  constituencies.json
```

Always check the output. It is very easy to "destroy" the map by using too much simplification - always properly check the output.
