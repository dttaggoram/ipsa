This year's **Pentaho Community Meeting** took place in one of Europa's most vibrant cities: **London**. We had slightly over 120 online registrations, out of which 101 actually turned up at the event, which I think is a pretty good number. Not only did we manage to attract visitors from throughout Europe, but also the USA and Brazil. With an impressive line-up of speakers, there was something for every Pentaho fan available. 

Pentaho (the company) put a lot of emphasis on the community, for the first time ever sponsoring half of the costs of the event and also providing key speakers like **Bob Kemper** (Executive VP of Engineering) and **Pedro Alves**. It was reassuring to hear the direction that the company was going after the Hitachi take-over. While quite a few people initially had their concerns about this acquistion, the general consensus this time was that the future is bright.

Quite a few new community projects were presented, which is a very healthy sign. **Roland Bouman** presented not one, not two, but three BA Server Plugins! And each one of these plugins show great potential. **Antonio Garcia-Dominguez** spoke about his project, which focuses on hierarchical tagging for Pentaho BA Server resources. **SÃ©bastien Jelsch** impressed the audience with his **Mondrian** on **Apache Kylin** project. And **Miguel Cunhal** surprised quite a few people with his PDI tips. The list goes on and on ... I didn't have the chance to see all the talks, so please forgive me if I did not mentioned your name here: You all contributed enormously to this event!

Looking back on the event, I must say it was amazing! **Nelson Sousa** and **Dan Keeley** with a little help from myself did an amazing job in organising this event. The atmosphere was also very good: I am sure I was not the only one enjoying talking to the many Pentaho enthusiasts and professionals and tying new connections! I also feel like I learnt a few new things, exchanged interesting ideas and I got some hints into which topics I should look into in the coming months.

Looking forward to **next year**, it seems like we already have a few people volunteering to organise the event. **Madrid**, **Florence** and **Edinburgh** are possible candidates. If you feel also like organising the event, please come forward. There will be a democratic election at the beginning of next year on the location of the event.

**So in a nutshell**: How was `#pcm15`? **Awesome!** And over course, all this would not have been possible without the **Pentaho community**:
